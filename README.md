**Shareware Expo - React Native & Supabase Project**

**Project Overview**

Sharewear is a mobile application built using React Native and Supabase that facilitates the process of donating and requesting items for beneficiaries and donors. The application is designed to help those in need connect with donors who have items to give, making it easier for both parties to meet their needs.

**Key Features**

**Beneficiary Side:**


* Create Donation Requests: Beneficiaries can create requests for specific items they need.
* View Requests: Beneficiaries can view their requests and see the status of each one.


**Donor Side:**
* Select Items to Donate: Donors can select items they want to donate.
* View Applicable Requests: Donors can view donation requests that match the items they wish to donate.
* Filter by Category/Group: Donors can filter requests by item categories or beneficiary groups (e.g., schools, orphans).
* Commit to Donation: Donors can commit to a donation, which must be fulfilled within 24 hours.
* Confirmation of Receipt: Once the donation is made, admins will confirm receipt to complete the process.
